Install Required Applications
=============================================================================

Building RStudio requires installations of a number of applications
(including R). These applications include:

R:         http://www.r-project.org/
Rtools:    http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
CMake:     http://www.cmake.org/ (choose "Add to system path" during install)
Java:      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads
Ant:       http://code.google.com/p/winant
NSIS:      http://nsis.sourceforge.net
Qt:        http://www.qt.io/

Installing Qt
=============================================================================

RStudio currently builds against Qt 5.4.1 on Windows. You can download it here:

http://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.4/5.4.1/qt-opensource-windows-x86-mingw491_opengl-5.4.1.exe


Installing Rtools
=============================================================================

In the past, RStudio used the MinGW toolchain packaged with Qt for compilation
of C / C++ code; however, RStudio now uses RTools 3.3 to ensure compatibility
with versions of R built with the newer RTools toolchain. The dependency 
script described below under "Satisfy Additional Dependencies" will download
and install RTools.

Update System Path
=============================================================================

Building RStudio requires that the CMake executables are accessible via the
system path  (note that CMake should already be accessible via the CMake
installer if the "Add to system path" option was chosen during installation).

You should also ensure that your R installation's bin directory is on the
system path. For example:

C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.1\bin\i386


Satisfy Additional Dependencies
=============================================================================

Additional dependencies (RTools, boost, GWT, and gin) can be satisfied by
running the following script:

install-dependencies.cmd


Installing Boost
=============================================================================

RStudio provides an R script that automatically downloads and builds Boost.
Find this script at:

https://www.github.com/rstudio/rstudio/tree/master/dependencies/windows/install-boost/install-boost.R

Running this script currently produces a packaged zipfile of Boost 1.50 (32bit
and 64bit), built using the MinGW toolchain provided as part of Rtools 3.3.


NOTE: Getting boost to work with mingw64
=============================================================================

See the following article for general approach/guidelines:

http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mingw-w64/wiki/Building%20Boost

In order to build rstudio with boost under win32 we had to apply the 
following patch (so that boost can correctly detect mingw64 as distinct
from another mingw distribution:

https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/changeset/79334

This should be fixed in more recent versions of boost, see:

https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4258

Note that in order to build rstudio with boost under win64 we had to make
the following additional accomodations:

1) define BOOST_USE_WINDOWS_H to eliminate errors compiling boost::thread
   (see thread: http://lists.boost.org/boost-users/2010/02/55945.php)

2) #undef BOOST_USE_WINDOWS_H prior to including <boost/interprocess/*>
within BoostErrors.hpp

3) add a dummy definitions for boost::thread::tss_cleanup_implemented
   (see ticket: https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4258)
