Install Required Applications
=============================================================================

Building RStudio requires installations of a number of applications 
(including R). These applications include:

- R:         http://www.r-project.org/
- XCode:     https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
- CMake:     http://www.cmake.org/

Note that after installing XCode you should also be sure to install the XCode
Command Line Tools (which can be done via Preferences -> Downloads)

Satisfy Additional Dependencies
=============================================================================

Additional dependencies can be satisfied by running the following script:

./install-dependencies-osx

Note that this script includes download, extraction, and compilation of
boost so can take some time (30-60 minutes) to complete.
